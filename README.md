This is the readme file of the manufacturing dataset.
This name for the dataset will be changed later to a more appealing name that will be easy to call.
This dataset is created after studying how manufacturing industries run their machineries, machine outputs, factors that affect machine outputs and so on and so forth.
It is important to read the word document first before using the dataset so that you can understand the dataset before embarking on your use cases for it.


Happy Digging!!!
